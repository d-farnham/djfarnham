I combine earth science, data science, and systems analysis to <br />
(1) identify vulnerabilities of our water and energy infrastructure to climate variability and climate change, <br />
(2) quantify climate hazards to these critical infrastructure systems, and <br />
(3) conduct research that supports efforts to design and operate adaptive and resilient engineered water and energy systems that limit exposure to climate risks and make use of the opportunities presented by nature.
