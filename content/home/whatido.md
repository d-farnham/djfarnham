# Why I do what I do
As the end of the 2010s draws nearer, risks from climate extremes are commanding increasing attention. The recent cluster of devastating tropical cyclones that hit Puerto Rico, Houston, and several others places have been a stark reminder that climate-related disasters can come in bunches, whether the anthropogenic warming is to blame for specific events or not. While floods like those recently in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_California_floods) have catastrophic impacts on individuals, I am encouraged by the increasing attention that is being paid to improving our estimation and prediction of these types of events by the public and private sector alike. My goal is to be a small part of this progress.

At the same time, the past several years , the prospects of a renewable energy future are looking increasingly likely. Regardless of the interannual variability of the political landscape, scientist, engineers, and the private sector have continued working on identifying and solving the challenges associated with a future in which we increasingly depend on renewable resources like solar and wind power generation, and driving down the costs of these technologies ([see page 10 of the report here](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-2017/)).


# What I do
As an engineer and scientist, my goal is to identify intellectually interesting questions that are *practically* useful to answer. While a great deal of innovation has spawned from the physicist, mathematician, or hobby scientists drive to pursue purely intellectual curiosities, I (attempt) to constrain myself to projects that if successful, will have some preconceived value to a stakeholder.  

Broadly, I am a researcher combining my training in engineering, statistics and climate science to focus on topics related to climate risk, water resources, and a 100% renewable electricity grid.
I examine the long-term trends, variability, and predictability of environmental variables to answer questions like: 
How has the occurrence and intensity of extreme precipitation changed over time?
How might the flood hazard change into the future in specific regions?
How does the covariability of extreme temperatures and surface winds impact prospects for a 100% renewable electricity grid?
How does antecedent precipitation impact the bacterial concentration of urban waterways?
