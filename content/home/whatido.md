# Why I do what I do
As the end of the 2010s draws nearer, risks from climate extremes are commanding increasing attention. The recent cluster of devastating tropical cyclones that hit Puerto Rico, Houston, and elsewhere have been a stark reminder that climate-related disasters can come in bunches, whether anthropogenic global warming is to blame for specific extreme events or not. While floods like those recently in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_California_floods) continue to have catastrophic impacts on individuals, I am encouraged by the increasing attention being paid to improving our estimation and prediction of these types of events by the public and private sector alike.

We are also at a time when the prospects of a fully renewable energy future are looking increasingly likely. Regardless of the interannual variability that exists in the political landscape, scientists and engineers have continued working on identifying and solving the variety of challenges associated with a future in which we increasingly depend on renewable resources like solar and wind power generation. At the same time, the costs of wind and solar power generation technologies are falling fast ([see page 10 of the report here](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-2017/)).

 My goal is to be a small part of the scientific progress in both of the above areas.

# What I do
As an engineer and scientist, I aspire to identify lines of investigation that are both intellectually interesting and *practically* useful to society. While a great deal of innovation has spawned from the physicist, mathematician, or hobby scientists drive to pursue purely intellectual curiosities, I attempt to constrain myself to projects that will have value to stakeholders.  

Broadly, I am a researcher combining my training in engineering, statistics and climate science to focus on topics related to climate risk, water resources, and a 100% renewable electricity grid.
I examine the long-term trends, variability, and predictability of environmental variables to answer questions like: 
How has the occurrence and intensity of extreme precipitation changed over time?
How might the flood hazard change into the future in specific regions?
How does the covariability of extreme temperatures and surface winds impact prospects for a 100% renewable electricity grid?
How does antecedent precipitation impact the bacterial concentration of urban waterways?
